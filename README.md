'Green Mind' design for CSS Zen Garden
===

This is [an old design I did for my blog](http://cheeaun.com/blog/2005/05/rebooted-into-greenery) and has been modified for [CSS Zen Garden](http://csszengarden.com/) before I redesigned the blog.

If my memory serves me correctly, I submitted this to CSS Zen Garden but it was rejected because it doesn't look *awesome* enough.
